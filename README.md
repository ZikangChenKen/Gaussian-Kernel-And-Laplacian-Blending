# Gaussian-Kernel-And-Laplacian-Blending
Implement function gaussian2D(sigma, kernel_size) that returns a 2D gaussian blur kernel, with input argument sigma specifying a tuple of x,y scales (standard deviations), and kernel_size specifying a tuple of x,y dimensions of the kernel. The kernel should be large enough to include 3 standard deviations per dimension.

Combined with Laplacian blending to combine the images.
